# 60 Days of Songs Project

Hello! Welcome to the code for my 60 Days project. You can see the [finished project here](https://60-days-songs.vercel.app/)

This project was built with Svelte and the [svelte-scroller](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte-scroller).

If you're interested in the data, you can find it in the [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19TFecu3WcWzq8lTjOSpV-N9qngKctNP1RmOz65mYJcM/edit#gid=0).

Song preview links are fetched from the [Spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/get-several-tracks).

Audio is a bit buggy on mobile, especially iOS :( I'll come around to fixing it when I have time.

And I think that is all! Thank you!
